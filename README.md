# Magpie Number Two
Magpie Number Two is a collaboratively-created resource of social justice successes. It's for people who see injustice in their lives and communities, and want to learn from the people who already fought issues like theirs and won. It's for solidarity across movements, communities and geographies, and for learning from those who came before us. 

Magpie Number Two will start as an advice column, so that people can write in with their own questions. 
Hopefully, the responses to these questions will start to form a framework for the website, so that people can find stories of successes, large and small.

## How can I contribute?
I'm working on this! 
Currently I'm setting up this repository, using what I've learned as a participant and mentor in [Open Seeds](https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds/) and as a contributor to the [Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/index.html). 
That means it's very Github-centric at the moment. 
- If you're comfortable with Github, feel free to open an issue with questions and/or suggestions!
- If Github is not (yet) your friend, I'll have an email address for you to contact soon.

## Why Magpie Number Two?
Magpies are intelligent birds: they learn from each other and from their own experiences. 
This project is about learning from others: we're not the first people to face these challenges, and we can learn from people who came before us, who fought injustice and won. 
This project is not aimed at people who want to be first to do something. It's for the second magpies, who come along later and learn from those who came before. 

Also, I'm from the UK, where there's a children's rhyme about magpies, traditionally used for predicting the future from the number of magpies you can see. 
One magpie predicts sorrow, but when the second one comes along: that means joy.
